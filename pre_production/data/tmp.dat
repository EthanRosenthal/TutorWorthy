Consequently tutoring space is limited.<br /><br />I exclusively teach the techniques and strategies to conquer the <a href=\"/lsat_tutors.aspx\" title=\"LSAT Tutor\">LSAT</a>. I have spent over 5 years perfecting my methods and have taught thousands of students how to dramatically raise their LSAT scores. One of the highest score increases that a student of mine has attained was 32 points (from a 145-177). It is pretty typical that my students increase their score between 20-25 points if they work extremely diligently. I am upbeat and motivated to help you get into the <a href=\"/law_tutors.aspx\" title=\"law Tutor\">law</a> school of your dreams!<br /><br />_____________________________________<br /><br />My Official LSAT Stats:<br /> - LSAT Score: 178 (99.9th percentile)<br /> - <a href=\"/logic_tutors.aspx\" title=\"logic Tutor\">Logic</a> Games: Perfect score<br /> - <a href=\"/reading_tutors.aspx\" title=\"reading Tutor\">Reading</a> Comprehension: Perfect score<br /> - Logical Reasoning: 1 incorrect question within a section<br /><br />Even though I attained a great score on the actual LSAT, it took a lot of work to get there. My first practice test score was a 156 which I was able to increase to a 178 using intuitive and effective techniques. These are the techniques that I have refined over the years and teach to my students to help them get 20+ point score increases.

In the process, I have accumulated over one thousand hours of invaluable tutoring experience. Show me a SAT or ACT problem that you're having trouble with -- I bet I have seen it before! Of course, there is much more to tutoring than \"knowing your stuff.\" I have also learned highly effective ways to convey the knowledge and skills necessary for success on these standardized tests. <br /><br />The tutoring that I offer is highly personalized. I form a test-prep plan based on the student's individual strengths and weaknesses. Progress is monitored through regular homework assignments. I also give students practice tests on a semi-regular basis in order to objectively measure progress and to gauge where instruction should be focused. The material I use consists of official ACT and SAT tests and that have been administered nationwide in the past.<br /><br />Tutoring is not only my job; it is a passion. I take great joy in helping my students. My work, as I see it, goes beyond preparing them for standardized tests. It involves helping them to develop skills that will serve them not only on their tests, but also in their current high school classes, their future college classes, and their eventual lives beyond academia. <br /><br />I recommend that sessions last for 1.5 hours, as this time length allows for the most effective tutoring. I meet with students in mutually convenient locations (i.e., coffee shops and libraries) in mid- or downtown Manhattan. I also offer in-house tutoring in mid- and downtown Manhattan.

{"rating": 4.9, "linked_subjects": {"Corporate Training": [], "Homeschool": [], "Elementary Education": [], "English": []}, "name": "Lauren W.", "bio": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHi there! My name is Lauren, and I recently graduated with honors from NYU with a BA in Fiction <a href=\"/writing_tutors.aspx\" title=\"writing Tutor\">Writing</a>. I work as a professional copywriter and <a href=\"/editor_tutors.aspx\" title=\"editor Tutor\">editor</a> and am halfway through a graduate program in Education and Special Education at Touro College. I plan to get an MFA in Fiction in a few years. <br /><br />I've been writing professionally since my freshman year in college, when I got my first copy-writing gig. I've been copy-writing and <a href=\"/editing_tutors.aspx\" title=\"editing Tutor\">editing</a> ever since, and have grown into somewhat of a <a href=\"/grammar_tutors.aspx\" title=\"grammar Tutor\">grammar</a> nitpick. (Annoying, I know!) <br /><br />In college, I focused significant energy on my creative writing skills. In my junior year, I was accepted into a master-level writing class with novelist Zadie Smith, and I've also studied independently with several other professors in NYU's creative writing department. Since graduation, I've become a co-organizer of an independent writing workshop, and frequently edit and critique other writers' short fiction and novellas. <br /><br />I was a huge procrastinator in college. I don't think I ever started a paper more than a night before the due date. I learned to be quick. Writing is an intense process for me, but because I'm a huge procrastinator, I've had to become very organized, and so I know how to get things done. I really love writing, and I really love editing, and as a recent graduate, I have a pretty good sense of what professors want. <br /><br />As an editor, I love helping people become better writers, so tutoring is a natural fit for me. Writing is a tricky thing--there isn't one right way to write an <a href=\"/essay_tutors.aspx\" title=\"essay Tutor\">essay</a>, which is why I find that using a writing tutor is helpful to anyone completing written assignments or creative work. In the past, I've tutored elementary, middle, and high school students in writing, and in the past few years I've started tutoring college students as well. I've also coached adults and other professional writers through their own writing projects. Right now, I'm most interested in helping out college students. <br /><br />My approach is simple--I want to figure out what works best for you. As I mentioned, writing is tricky, and there isn't one way to master it. I like to make sure that my clients understand the basics of collecting and organizing ideas, and from there we focus more on constructing the perfect paragraph and sentence. More advanced writers may want to focus on tone and voice, and this is something I tackle through a series of exercises. But again--I want to figure out what works for you. I can help you with written assignments, I can edit written assignments, or we can design a program suited to your level to really put writing skills into practice. Whatever works! I'm flexible and happy to help you figure out what will be the most beneficial. I also want sessions to be fun--you're not going to learn anything from me if you're bored.
